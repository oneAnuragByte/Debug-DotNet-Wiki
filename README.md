Assist migration of Debugging Skills from Windows to other platform

With the release of .NET Core for other platforms, it might feel a bit intimidating to move/implement your familiar debugging/Diagnostic skills from Windows to other Platform. 
.NET Core Team has done a great job to provide you with a great set of tools to debug issues that might come up on non-Windows Platform. And I feel that it would really help a lot, if we can provide a jump start to our debuggers by providing them almost-similar tools/techniques on other platforms which are analogous to what they used on Windows.
